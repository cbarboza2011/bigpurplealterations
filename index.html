But his most important alteration was a gun strap from an old family heirloom rifle which had broken. Eva fixed him up…..pants and gun strap.

				<img src="images/eva/eva2.PNG" alt="Eva Barnes" id="eva2">
				<p>Big Purple Alterations, Repair & Sewing is a custom stitchery business located in the Purple House across the street from the Mini Mart in Annapolis, MO.  The Sewing Queen, also known as Oz - Eva Barnes - works her magic with needle and thread.  A snip, a nip and a tuck... and a heavy foot on the sewing pedal will have you looking marvelous in your clothes in a jiffy.</p>
				<img src="images/purplehouse.jpg" alt="Purple House" id="purplehouse">
				<p>Purple House has a private dressing area where you can change into the item you need altered.  Eva will pin you up, then stitch you up.  You need an appointment for a fitting, so call in advance 573-598-1175.  Most items are completed in a week or so.  Super poofy prom and bridesmaid dresses requiring four city blocks of stitching length, take longer.</p>
				<p>Or you can use our drop-off service for items such as missing buttons, zipper replacements, rip repair, or patching. There’s not a whole lot of stuff she can’t sew, so bring it in and Eva will give you the low-down on everything from hiking up your britches to taking up your too-big (potentially ugly) bridesmaid dress.  She’ll make you look like a million bucks with her tucks.</p>
				<p>Each item is priced when we see it.  We can give you an estimated cost, but until we put our eyeballs on your sewing project, we can’t give you an exact cost. You’ll need cash or a credit card to pay half up front and the other half when you pick up.</p>

			<h1>About Eva Barnes (a.k.a: The Sewing Queen, Oz)</h1>
			<div class="aboutEva story-scroll">
				<img src="images/eva/eva1.JPG" alt="Eva Barnes"  id="eva">
				<p>I love sewing – it’s my happy place. I feel every stitch makes a difference for my customers, and it brings back so many great memories for me of sewing with my family.</p>
				<p>Sitting at my grandma’s feet under her sewing machine is one of my earliest childhood memories.</p>
				<p>I learned how to sew at a young age, starting with quilt blocks. I was making my own outfits by age twelve. I won second place in Missouri in the Sew with Cotton Contest on my first entry. By the time I was fifteen I was duplicating current fashions, and sewing them with my mom and grandma.</p>
				<p>When I was an early teen I began spending time hand quilting with my mom Patty Wisdom, my grandma Velda Keister, and my great grandma Eva Sutton, my namesake. Great Grandmother Sutton had a quilt rack hanging from her ceiling. My first big quilting project was an heirloom quilt made from clothing scraps of my Great Great Grandmother Dandridge.</p>
				<p>For many months of Saturdays, the four of us would meet at Grandma Velda’s house in Piedmont, MO, and we’d work on that quilt. I can remember how Mom, Grandma and Granny would riminess each square and its history. Grandmother Dandridge’s apron in a square, her Easter dress in a square, part of a nightgown in a square and so on.</p>
				<p>Years earlier Granny had made the top, but it had never been quilted to a bottom. So that’s what we did all those hours. We hand quilted the top to a bottom. There were a few mouse holes and to preserve the fabric we tightly stitched around the little chews so they would never fray.</p>
				<img src="images/mailbox.JPG" alt="Big Purple Alterations Mailbox with Sign" id="mailbox">
				<p>On my sixteenth birthday the quilt was finished. My parents purchased a cedar chest for me. The quilt was folded, prayed over, and placed in the cedar chest and gifted to me by Mom, Grandma and Granny. Three decades later when my oldest daughter Bethanie was married, I gave her both the cedar chest and the heirloom quilt. It will continue to be passed down.</p>
				<p>In between those years, I probably sewed 1000 miles. As an adult I’ve continued sewing – and now I manage an alteration business in the back of the Purple House in Annapolis, MO.</p>
				<p>My inspiration for sewing comes from Grandma Velda who owned and operated a kids clothing store in Piedmont in the 50’s. This was back in the day when Sunday Best was the trend, and everyone wore dress-up clothes to events, church, holidays, weddings, and especially Easter. She fitted boys for little suit jackets and slacks that she made, and she sewed hundreds of matching mother/daughter outfits. For all the years of her life, until recently, Grandma ran an alterations business out of her home.</p>
				<p>While Grandma was the inspiration, Mom was the producer – and I spent hours of my life sewing with my mother. My mom made many of our clothes, and when I got older I helped. We had a traveling family gospel group, and wearing identical outfits was the “thing” back then. We bought the fabric and made all of those matching outfits top to bottom.</p>
				<p>In the 80’s, Daisy Kingdom dresses were the rage. Piles and piles of ruffles, poofs and frills. Grandma and Mom sewed those for all my younger girl cousins for Easter dresses.</p>
				<p>I feel my sewing gives back. When my customers have a favorite jacket or some hunting gear they can’t wear because it’s ripped or torn, or the zipper is broken, <img src="images/eva/eva3.JPG" alt="Eva sewing" id="eva4">I like seeing how happy they are to reclaim that piece of clothing. Fixing a kids blankie in secret so he or she can keep on snuggling with it for years. Darting a wedding dress so it fits the bride perfectly, or the excitement of a giggling prom-dress girl waiting for a hem…I love all the ways sewing and alterations make people’s lives better.</p>
				<p>My kids call it Mom’s Sewing Mode. And I guess that’s what it is. I put love into every sewing thing I do.
				My happy place indeed.</p>

						<h1>Sewing by Hand?</h1>
							<ul>
								<li>Make sure you use a fine needle for a smoother stitch.</li>
								<li>Turn your needle ¼ turn with every stitch to prevent your thread from knotting up.</li>
								<li>Your Best Friend is a thimble.  Prevents you from poking holes in fingers and getting blood on material.</li>
								<li>Use a good quality thread not the cheapest you can find.  Remember cheaper is NOT always better.</li>

				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/barsoap.jpg" alt="Pins in Bar of Soap Image">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>From Stubborn to Smooth</h1>
						<p>Put dull, stubborn straight pins in a piece of bar soap to help them go through fabric much easier.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/clearpolish.jpg" alt="Clear polish on a button image">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Polish Your Buttons</h1>
						<p>After sewing buttons on, cover them with a coat of clear nail polish to keep the thread from unraveling and to hold the button in place longer.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/diycushion.jpg" alt="DIY Pincushion Image">

					<div class="text">
						<h1>Bobbin Organizer</h1>
						<p>Keep your filled bobbins together by storing them in a foam toe separator for pedicures.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/rust.jpg" alt="Scissors plus Water Equals Rust Image">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Avoid Moisture</h1>
						<p>Ironing and sewing go hand in hand, but irons usually have water in them so we can steam as we press, and moisture is not good for your scissors. Avoid setting your scissors on your ironing board, as your board will retain the moisture from the steam a lot longer than you may think.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/fabriconly.jpg" alt="Fabric Only Meme">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Cut Fabric Only</h1>
						<p>It’s tempting to reach for your closest pair of scissors when you need to cut something, but you should reserve your good fabric scissors for only cutting fabric, thread, and ribbons without wire.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/spare.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Have a Spare Pair</h1>
						<p>Have an alternate pair of scissors on hand for cutting wired ribbon, patterns, fusible interfacing, and other things that might damage your fabric scissors.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/sharpen.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Keep It Sharp</h1>
						<p>Have your scissors sharpened regularly by a professional knife sharpener. This isn’t something I suggest doing at home, as if you damage the blades, there is little chance they can be repaired. Check with the local fabric store near you, or if you have Gingher scissors, try their mail-order sharpening service.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/wipeclean.jpeg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Wipe Them Clean</h1>
						<p>As your scissors get full of lint, frequently wipe them down with a dry soft cloth, like muslin, to keep the blades free of lint and other fabric fuzz.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/avoidpins.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Always Avoid Pins</h1>
						<p>When you pin your pattern to your fabric, be sure to keep your pins within the paper so you do not accidently cut over a pin while cutting the fabric. Using pins with a ball on the end will help you spot them along the way.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/drop.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Don't Drop Them!</h1>
						<p>Dropping your scissors can knock the blades out of alignment, even if dropped on carpet, but especially if dropped on wood or concrete floors. So do your best to keep them on the cutting table or in safe storage at all times.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/case.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Keep the Case Closed</h1>
						<p>Most good scissors will come with a case or sleeve to keep your scissors safe and protected when not in use, so use the case at all times to keep the blades clean and free from dust.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/nicescissors.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Make a Worthy Investment</h1>
						<p>All-metal scissors can be a costly investment, but a quality pair will cut better, last longer, and can be sharpened over and over again. Plastic is nearly impossible to repair if broken, so scissors with plastic handles will never last as long as those made of quality metal.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/preview.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Cut at the Right Spot</h1>
						<p>Cutting thin fabrics and small areas like notches, using the tips of the scissors is great, but when cutting thick and heavy fabrics, rely on the part of the scissors where the two blades separate near the joint with the screw. Cutting heavy fabric with the tips can possibly pull the blades out of alignment.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/hairspray.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Spray Your Ends</h1>
						<p>Tired of trying over and over to thread a needle with a limp piece of thread and no success? Spray the tip of your thread with hairspray to quickly thread a needle! Keep a travel sized can of hairspray near your sewing machine for easy access.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/golftee.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Golf Tee Toppers</h1>
						<p>A golf tee is a perfect way to organize a spool of thread and its matching bobbin. Place the bobbin on top of the spool of thread and insert the golf tee. Easy peasy, right? No more digging through your bobbins trying to find the right color!</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/ribbonbasket.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Wire Basket Organizer</h1>
						<p>Use a wire basket to easily gain access to your most used trims and ribbons. Guide the ribbon through an opening at the bottom edge of the basket and keep a pair of scissors stored in the basket. I feel like some might bring the toilet paper argument in here. Just in case, let me tell you that Yes, they are in fact threaded the correct way.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/magnetdish.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Magnetized Pin & Needle Dish</h1>
						<p>Keeping your pins organized is essential in efficient sewing. You don’t want to have them falling all over the floor – that can be very painful when you’re barefoot. A great trick to keeping pins together is to hot glue magnets onto the bottom of a shallow bowl or saucer. The magnets will keep your pins neatly in the dish and you can get on with your sewing.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/magnetpickup.jpg" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Magnet Picker-Upper</h1>
						<p>While you may have a pin cushion nearby, dropping those pesky pins can be frustrating at best. When you’re sewing, it’s important to be sure that you’ve picked up and put away all your pins – believe me when I say those things really hurt when you step on them. Keep a magnet handy when sewing and use it to ensure that you’ve gotten all your pins and needles when you’re finished.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="carousel-slide">
					<img src="images/sewing-tips/scissornecklace.JPG" alt="">
					<div class="text">
						<h1>Scissor Necklace</h1>
						<p>Have you ever been just sewing away and then suddenly couldn’t find your scissors? I do this all the time when I’m gift wrapping, and it can be very frustrating. Well, there’s a hack for that. You can create a great scissor necklace that holds those scissors right there on you, so you’ll always know where they are. The best part? You only need a long piece of ribbon to make it.</p>
